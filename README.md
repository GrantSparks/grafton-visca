# grafton-visca

Rust based VISCA over IP implementation for controlling PTZ Cameras

Currently only PTZOptics G2 VISCA over IP Commands are implemented.

** Impotant Note: This is a work in progress and is not yet ready for production use. I am only validating the byte sequences as I use the commands so many have not been checked against the documentation. **
